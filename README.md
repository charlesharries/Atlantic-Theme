# Atlantic

A dark blue colour scheme, trying not to make anything too complicated. Very similar to nighttime Atlantic colours.

Based on [my clone](https://github.com/charlesharries/Sublime-Darkmatter-Theme) of Patrick Muller's [Darkmatter](https://github.com/patrickemuller/Sublime-Darkmatter-Theme), itself based on [TronLight](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/TronLight/).

***

## How to Install, manually (since it isn't on Package Control)

1. [Download the .zip](https://github.com/charlesharries/Atlantic-Theme/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip and rename the folder to `Atlantic-Theme`
3. Copy the folder into `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...`

***

## How to Activate

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>,</kbd> on Mac).

You can choose whichever flavor you like, but don't forget to change *both* color scheme and UI theme so they match.

***Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.***

## Special Thanks to

Patrick Muller, creator of the Darkmatter theme that this theme is based on, and...

Creator of [TronLight Theme](http://colorsublime.com/theme/TronLight) theme, which I think came before Darkmatter.
