Thanks for installing Atlantic! I think you're now one of like two people using Atlantic, which makes you part of a very elite club. Good job.

This is for the most part just a port of a theme called Darkmatter, which itself is a port of a couple of themes called Tron Light and Spacegray I think. This one is a little bit more refined, I feel like.
